## Who are we?

We are a software development team founded by two middle-school students

Currently developing a multiarchitecture (and kind of portable) OS in the following languages:

- Batch (Windows Scripting Language) 
- C
- RSC (ReadableSourceCode) esolang by us

# Exactly what you are thinking

Since the OS uses the RSC language, it's called rscÂ² (as in its own interpreted language squared!)
